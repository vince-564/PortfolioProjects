# Vincent Dotson - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me

Hello, I am Vincent Dotson, and I have been navigating the realm of data analytics for a significant period now. From the outset, I found immense joy in this field, prompting me to embark on the journey of pursuing a master’s in science to deepen my knowledge.

Working with numbers and information has always been a passion of mine and being a data analyst seemed like the perfect fit. Over time, I have come to appreciate the constant learning that comes with this profession. Each day presents a new challenge, demanding a keen understanding of the intricacies of the tasks at hand.

My personality is well-suited to the demands of this role, as I enjoy delving into every detail to unravel insights and make informed decisions. The dynamic nature of the field keeps me engaged, and I continually strive to stay ahead by embracing emerging technologies and methodologies.

As I continue to evolve in my career, I look forward to further contributing to the fascinating and ever-expanding world of data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
Below is the list of data analytic projects that I have conducted.
### Training Machine Learning / Computer Vision Algorithms
Code: [CIFAR_10_DATA_PartI.ipynb](Python/CIFAR_10_DATA_PartI.ipynb), [CIFAR_10_DATA_PartII.ipynb](Python/CIFAR_10_DATA_PartII.ipynb)

Goal: To teach a computer how to recognize objects. The model was built then a second iteration of the model was built in attempt to improve performance.

Description: The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images distributed across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. These classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The dataset is commonly used for training and evaluating machine learning and deep learning models for image classification tasks.

Skills: Python Programming, Deep Learning Concepts, TensorFlow, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Understanding CIFAR-10 Dataset, Experience with Model Architectures

Technology: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Data Science, Cybersecurity, Quantum Computing.

Result: Upon completion of the machine learning project on the CIFAR-10 dataset, the results would entail metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, alongside a confusion matrix to assess the model's classification performance. Visualizations and comparative analyses would provide insights into the model's behavior and benchmark its effectiveness, guiding potential deployment strategies and future research directions.
### CovidDeaths
Code: [DataAnalysis_COVID_Dataset](SQL/DataAnalysis_Examples)

Description: The dataset comprises of deaths related to the Covid-19 virus. This project encompasses cleaning the data and conducting analysis to facilitate insights on trends and patterns.

Skills: SQL Queries, Data Cleaning Techniques, Data Transformation, Indexing and Optimization, Statistical Analysis in SQL, Data Visualization Tools

Technology: MySQL, phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, Navicat for MySQL, HeidiSQL, Sequel Pro

Result: After cleaning the Covid-19 death dataset, insightful analysis revealed emerging trends and patterns, providing valuable understanding of the virus's impact, and informing future public health strategies.
### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
Code: [DataCleaning_NashvilleHousing_Dataset](SQL/DataCleaning_Examples)

Description: The dataset comprises a compilation of homes sold in Nashville spanning from 2013 to 2019. This project encompasses the initial stages of data handling, including loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.

Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Programming Skills, Domain Knowledge, Critical Thinking

Technology: MySQL, phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, Navicat for MySQL, HeidiSQL, Sequel Pro

Result: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Nashville Housing Dataset can lead to a clearer and more readable dataset, enhancing insights into housing market trends.
### Excel_Workbook
Code: [Workbook](https://github.com/vince-564/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Excel/Excel_WorkBook.xlsx)

Description: Within the workbook are exercises of varying degrees of complexity that showcase my skills related to Excel

Skills: Formulas and Functions, Data Analysis, Data Validation, Array Formulas, Scenario Analysis, Advanced Data Cleaning, Problem Solving

Technology: Microsoft Excel

Result: Successfully complete workbook challenges
### Tableau
#### Dataset Description: The dataset comprises synthesized information concerning employees within a corporate environment, encompassing demographic profiles, work tenure, departmental affiliations, and salary details.
